# WiFi-Mode-Manager

This is a simple Qt experiment. It lists the current wireless interfaces in your system and gives info about their mode.


## Installing

If you build the package using `python -m build`, some files will appear in the `dist/` folder.
Thereafter, you can install the `.whl` using `pip install dist/wifi_mode_manager-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl` and execute `wifi-mode-manage` to open the app.


### Developer mode

Try `pip install -e .` and call `wifi-mode-manager` to execute the window each time you can test new changes.
